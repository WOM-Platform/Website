      "B": "By accepting specific kinds of WOM&nbsp;vouchers, merchants can indirectly contribute to a social campaign, incentivizing citizens contributing to the shared goal with their voluntary efforts.\n            Also, merchants can increase their visibility to the community working towards the shared goal."
