                        <p>A WOM, acronym for <i>Worth One Minute</i>, is a “digital voucher” granted to volunteers who dedicate one minute of their time to the common good.</p>

                        <p>WOMs are anonymous, but they retain information on the <i>aim</i> for which they were earned and on the <i>time</i> and <i>place</i> where this happened. Aims of collective interest are established by an ethical committee and the platform is open to be adopted by any instrument or initiative that works towards recognized aims.</p>
                        
                        <p>WOMs are managed by a mobile app, installed on personal device of volunteers, and they can be monetized thanks to third-party merchants that are willing to reward volunteers (thus giving their own contribution to the aim) by granting discounts on goods and services. Merchants can apply filters to collected WOMs (filtering on aim, place, and time) in order to accept only those WOMs which are more coherent with their own motivations and aims.</p>

                        <h3>How does it work?</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Volunteers install a mobile application on their mobile devices. This is a free app, called the “WOM&nbsp;Pocket”.</li>
                            <li>Merchants may use a mobile application, called the “WOM&nbsp;POS”, a Web app, or custom integrations to accept WOMs.</li>
                            <li>Instrument owners (e.g., non-profit organizations, associations, etc.) may contact <a href="mailto:info@wom.social">info@wom.social</a> to integrate their systems with the platform and start generating WOMs.</li>
                            <li>Interactions between “WOM&nbsp;Pocket” and “WOM&nbsp;POS” is based on QR&nbsp;Codes.</li>
                        </ul>
