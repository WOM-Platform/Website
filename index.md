# The WOM Platform

The WOM or “Worth One Minute” platform is a public general purpose rewarding system.
It is meant as a meeting point between public initiatives for the common good (such as mobile crowd-sensing systems, learning or teaching initiatives, and so on) and third-parties stakeholders that wish to promote such initiatives (in a given area, a given period of time, or by a given community).

The system is currently in development at DIGIT s.r.l..
